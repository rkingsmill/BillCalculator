# Bill Calculator

This project is a framework to calculate the total for a bill. It was from a senior take home assessement that had the following requirements:
* Outputs are deterministic and must include:
  * tax total
  * discount total
  * bill subtotal (excluding taxes and discounts)
  * bill total (including taxes and discounts)
* Taxes can be category specific
* Discounts can be dollar or percentage amount
* Items can be tax exempt
* There can be multiple discounts and the order applied will change totals
